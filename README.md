Improving my algorithms skills on [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/Nail_Gafiyatov/)

As a hobby, I created a Software engineer token in the Solidity language, which you can find on the BSCScan website (the official portal for tracking crypto transactions and getting to know projects) at the [link](https://bscscan.com/token/0x4c40f01e21ee29cb2c97112c602227c645a4f3ab). You can replenish the liquidity pool in the SET/BNB pair or in any pair with SET using the [link](https://pancakeswap.finance/add/0x4C40f01e21Ee29cb2C97112C602227c645a4F3Ab/BNB).
